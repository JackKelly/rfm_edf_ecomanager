Code for communicating wirelessly with [Current Cost home energy monitors](http://www.currentcost.com/products.html)
and [EDF EcoManager](http://www.edfenergy.com/products-services/for-your-home/ecomanager/) monitors.  The main planned aim of this code is the
robust gathering of data from an arbitrary number of EDF EcoManager
[Wireless Transmitter Plugs](https://shop.edfenergy.com/Item.aspx?id=540&CategoryID=1) and a small number of
Current Cost transmitters (IAMs and whole-house transmitters) for tracking the state of the majority of appliances
in a building.

Current status
==============

At present the code is in a very early stage.  The code as-is
will capture and display all Current Cost or EDF EcoManager RF packets it
receives.
