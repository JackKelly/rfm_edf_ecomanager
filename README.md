This code runs on a [Nanode](http://www.nanode.eu/) / [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) with a 433MHz wireless module and wirelessly communicates with [Current Cost home energy monitors](http://www.currentcost.com/products.html) and [EDF EcoManager](http://www.edfenergy.com/products-services/for-your-home/ecomanager/) monitors.  The main aim of this code is the robust gathering of data from an arbitrary number of EDF EcoManager
[Wireless Transmitter Plugs](https://shop.edfenergy.com/Item.aspx?id=540&CategoryID=1) and a small number of
Current Cost whole-house "sensable" transmitters for tracking the state of the majority of appliances
in a building.


Current status
